**My Contribution**: I conducted literature reviews on sensor spoofing and adversarial attacks in autonomous vehicle systems. I synthesized findings from 15 papers and assisted in drafting, editing, and formatting. This work served as my first formal research collaboration and introduced me to cybersecurity applications of AI. I authored the comparative analysis of AV sensor attack strategies and defense effectiveness (Section IV and initial tables in that section).
